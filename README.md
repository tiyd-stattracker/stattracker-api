*Stat Tracker 2000* - the place to go to track all the important activities in your life.  Make sure your dog never has to "remind" you that you forgot to walk him.  Did you get all 8 glasses of water today?  How many miles did you run today?  Now you can keep track and even get a report for each activity over the last 30 days.

To run the Stat Tracker 2000, go to your web browser and navigate to https://lit-hollows-3591.herokuapp.com/docs/
